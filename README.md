# ConvLSTM-AE_VAD_ICME2017
This repo is the reimplementation code of ![Remembering history with convolutional LSTM for anomaly detection
, ICME 2017 by Weixin Luo, Wen Liu and Shenghua Gao](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019325). The official implementation is in https://github.com/zachluo/convlstm_anomaly_detection.

It is implemented in Pytorch. Please follow the instructions to run the code.
### 1. Installation (Anaconda with python3.6 installation is recommended)

### 2. Download datasets

### 3. Testing on saved models

### 4. Training from scratch (here we use ped2 and avenue datasets for examples)

### Notes
The Dataset module is based on a TensorFlow implementation of xxx, the ConvLSTMCell module is based on a tensorflow implementation of xxx. Thanks for their nice work.
